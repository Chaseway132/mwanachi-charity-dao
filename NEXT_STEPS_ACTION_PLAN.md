---

## üöÄ Next Month (Priority 3)

### 7. Smart Contract Security Audit ‚è±Ô∏è 3-5 days
**Why:** Protect user funds
**Action:**
```bash
# Internal review:
# - Check for reentrancy
# - Check access control
# - Check input validation
# - Check overflow/underflow

# Run static analysis:
npm install -g slither-analyzer
slither contracts/

# Consider professional audit
# (Budget: $5,000-$20,000)
```
**Deliverable:** Security audit report

---

### 8. Deploy to Polygon Mainnet ‚è±Ô∏è 1-2 days
**Why:** Go live with real blockchain
**Action:**
```bash
# Get mainnet MATIC (buy from exchange)
# Deploy contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-all-new.js --network polygon

# Verify on PolygonScan
# Update all configurations
# Test with real transactions
```
**Deliverable:** Contracts live on Polygon mainnet

---

### 9. Backend Production Deployment ‚è±Ô∏è 1-2 days
**Why:** Serve users reliably
**Options:**
```
A) AWS EC2 (Most control)
B) Heroku (Easiest)
C) Railway/Render (Good balance)
D) DigitalOcean (Affordable)
```
**Action:**
```bash
# 1. Choose hosting
# 2. Set up server
# 3. Install Node.js
# 4. Deploy backend
# 5. Set environment variables
# 6. Configure SSL/HTTPS
# 7. Set up monitoring
```
**Deliverable:** Backend running on production server

---

### 10. Frontend Production Deployment ‚è±Ô∏è 1 day
**Why:** Serve optimized frontend to users
**Options:**
```
A) Vercel (Recommended, free tier)
B) Netlify (Good alternative)
C) AWS S3 + CloudFront
D) Your own server
```
**Action:**
```bash
# 1. Build production bundle
npm run build

# 2. Deploy to hosting
# 3. Set environment variables
# 4. Configure custom domain
# 5. Set up analytics
```
**Deliverable:** Frontend live at your domain

## üéØ Decision Points

**Before you start, decide:**

1. **Database:** Firebase or MongoDB?
2. **Hosting:** AWS, Heroku, Railway, or other?
3. **Domain:** What's your production domain?
4. **Monitoring:** Sentry for errors? DataDog for metrics?
5. **Security:** Professional audit or internal only?

---

## üìû Questions to Answer

1. **Timeline:** When do you want to launch?
2. **Budget:** What's your hosting/audit budget?
3. **Users:** How many users initially?
4. **Scale:** Expected growth in 6 months?
5. **Support:** Will you have 24/7 support?

---

## üöÄ Recommended Order

**If you want to launch in 4 weeks:**

```
Week 1: M-Pesa credentials + Database setup
Week 2: Deploy to Mumbai testnet + Database integration
Week 3: Smart contract audit + M-Pesa testing
Week 4: Deploy to mainnet + Backend/Frontend deployment
```

**If you want to launch in 2 weeks:**

```
Week 1: M-Pesa credentials + Database setup + Mumbai deployment
Week 2: Mainnet deployment + Backend/Frontend deployment
(Skip professional audit, do internal review)
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Test everything on Mumbai first** - It's free and safe
2. **Keep private keys secure** - Use hardware wallet if possible
3. **Monitor from day 1** - Set up alerts before launch
4. **Have a rollback plan** - Know how to revert if needed
5. **Document everything** - Future you will thank you
6. **Start small** - Launch with limited users first
7. **Get feedback early** - Real users will find issues
