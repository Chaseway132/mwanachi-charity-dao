# ✅ NAVIGATION CLEANUP - COMPLETE!

## 🎯 WHAT WAS DONE

You identified that the navigation menu was **congested** with too many tabs. I've cleaned it up by removing the **"💬 Comments"** tab from the main navigation since users can access comments directly from the **Special Causes** section.

---

## 📋 CHANGES MADE

### **1. Updated Tab Type** (Line 78)
**Before:**
```typescript
type Tab = 'dashboard' | 'proposals' | 'donations' | 'special-donations' | 'special-donation-detail' | 'beneficiaries' | 'signers' | 'community-comments' | 'admin' | 'help';
```

**After:**
```typescript
type Tab = 'dashboard' | 'proposals' | 'donations' | 'special-donations' | 'special-donation-detail' | 'beneficiaries' | 'signers' | 'admin' | 'help';
```

### **2. Removed Comments Button from Navigation** (Lines 486-491)
**Removed:**
```typescript
<button
  onClick={() => setActiveTab('community-comments')}
  className={`px-3 py-2 rounded-md ${activeTab === 'community-comments' ? 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-900' : 'text-gray-600 hover:bg-gray-50'}`}
>
  💬 Comments
</button>
```

### **3. Removed Comments Case from renderContent()** (Lines 410-415)
**Removed:**
```typescript
case 'community-comments':
  return (
    <>
      <CommunityComments />
    </>
  );
```

### **4. Removed CommunityComments Import** (Line 26)
**Removed:**
```typescript
import CommunityComments from './components/CommunityComments';
```

### **5. Updated Page Title** (Line 556)
**Removed:**
```typescript
{activeTab === 'community-comments' && '💬 Community Comments'}
```

**Added:**
```typescript
{activeTab === 'admin' && '🔐 Admin Dashboard'}
```
