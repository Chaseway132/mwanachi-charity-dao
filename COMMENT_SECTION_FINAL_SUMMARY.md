## 🎯 WHY YOU CAN'T SEE IT

**The comment section is fully implemented, but you can't see it because:**

❌ **The backend server is NOT running**

The CommentSection component tries to fetch comments from the API:
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/comments/special-donation/:campaignId
```

Without the backend running, the API is unavailable, so the component shows "No comments yet" message.

---

## 🚀 HOW TO SEE IT

### Step 1: Start Backend Server
```powershell
cd backend
node server.js
```

Expected output:
```
🚀 Backend server running on port 5000
📍 Health check: http://localhost:5000/health
```

### Step 2: Start Frontend Server (new terminal)
```powershell
cd charity-dao-frontend
npm start
```

Expected output:
```
Compiled successfully!
Local: http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3: Open Browser
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 4: Navigate to Comment Section
1. Click "Special Donations" tab
2. Click on a campaign (e.g., "Ojwang' Memorial Fund")
3. Scroll down to "💬 Community Comments"
4. **You should now see the comment section!**
