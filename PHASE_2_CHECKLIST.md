## üîß Your Action Items (URGENT)

### Step 1: Get M-Pesa Credentials
**Timeline:** This week
**Action:** Register at Safaricom Daraja API

- [ ] Go to https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/
- [ ] Click "Register"
- [ ] Fill in business details
- [ ] Verify email
- [ ] Create an app
- [ ] Get credentials:
  - [ ] Consumer Key
  - [ ] Consumer Secret
  - [ ] Business Shortcode
  - [ ] Passkey

**Note:** This is free and takes ~30 minutes

### Step 2: Update Environment File
**Timeline:** Immediately after getting credentials
**Action:** Configure backend with M-Pesa credentials

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `backend/.env`:
```
MPESA_CONSUMER_KEY=your_key_here
MPESA_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_secret_here
MPESA_BUSINESS_SHORTCODE=your_shortcode_here
MPESA_PASSKEY=your_passkey_here
MPESA_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- [ ] Add Consumer Key
- [ ] Add Consumer Secret
- [ ] Add Business Shortcode
- [ ] Add Passkey
- [ ] Set environment to `sandbox`
- [ ] Set BACKEND_URL to `http://localhost:5000`

### Step 3: Test M-Pesa in Sandbox
**Timeline:** After updating `.env`
**Action:** Verify M-Pesa integration works

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd backend
npm start

# Terminal 2: Test STK Push
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/mpesa/stk-push \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "phoneNumber": "254712345678",
    "amount": 100,
    "accountReference": "test-donation",
    "description": "Test donation"
  }'
```

- [ ] Backend starts without errors
- [ ] STK Push endpoint responds
- [ ] Response includes `CheckoutRequestID`
- [ ] No authentication errors

### Step 4: Test Callback Handling
**Timeline:** After STK Push works
**Action:** Verify backend receives M-Pesa callbacks

- [ ] Set up ngrok or similar to expose localhost
- [ ] Update BACKEND_URL in `.env` to public URL
- [ ] Test with M-Pesa sandbox
- [ ] Verify callback is received
- [ ] Verify donation is recorded

### Step 5: Test with Real M-Pesa (Optional)
**Timeline:** After sandbox testing works
**Action:** Test with real M-Pesa (small amounts)

- [ ] Change MPESA_ENVIRONMENT to `production`
- [ ] Test with 1 KES donation
- [ ] Verify payment goes through
- [ ] Verify callback is received
- [ ] Verify donation is recorded
