# 🎯 Special Donations Feature - Design & Implementation

## 📋 Problem Statement

The current platform supports:
- ✅ **General Donations** → Proposals → Voting → Fund Distribution

But it doesn't support:
- ❌ **Emergency/Special Donations** for specific individuals (e.g., Ojwang' case)
- ❌ **Direct fundraising** for individuals in crisis
- ❌ **Rapid response** to urgent needs
- ❌ **Individual beneficiary tracking**

## 💡 Solution: Special Donations System
