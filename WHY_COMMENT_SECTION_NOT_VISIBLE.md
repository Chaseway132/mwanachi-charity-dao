# 🔍 Why You Can't See the Comment Section in Frontend

## 📌 THE ISSUE

You can't see the comment section in the frontend because **the backend server is not running**.

The comment section component is **fully implemented and integrated**, but it needs the backend API to fetch and display comments.

---

## 🔧 HOW IT WORKS

### Frontend Flow
```
1. User navigates to Special Donations detail page
2. SpecialDonationDetail component renders
3. CommentSection component is rendered (line 250)
4. CommentSection tries to fetch comments from API
5. API call: GET http://localhost:5000/api/comments/special-donation/:campaignId
6. Backend returns comments
7. Comments are displayed in the UI
```

### Why It's Not Visible
```
❌ Backend server is NOT running
❌ API endpoint is NOT available
❌ CommentSection can't fetch comments
❌ Component shows "No comments yet" message
❌ User doesn't see the comment section working
```

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: START THE BACKEND SERVER

### Option 1: Using Helper Script (Recommended)
```powershell
# Run from project root
.\start-servers.ps1
```

This will:
- ✅ Start backend on http://localhost:5000
- ✅ Start frontend on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Both servers run in separate windows

### Option 2: Manual Start

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```powershell
cd backend
node server.js
```

Expected output:
```
🚀 Backend server running on port 5000
📍 Health check: http://localhost:5000/health
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```powershell
cd charity-dao-frontend
npm start
```

Expected output:
```
Compiled successfully!
You can now view charity-dao-frontend in the browser.
Local: http://localhost:3000
```

### Option 3: Using npm scripts

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```powershell
cd backend
npm start
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```powershell
cd charity-dao-frontend
npm start
```

## 🧪 VERIFY IT'S WORKING

### Step 1: Check Backend Health
```powershell
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "Backend is running",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-21T..."
}
```

### Step 2: Check Comment Endpoint
```powershell
curl http://localhost:5000/api/comments/special-donation/1
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 0,
  "comments": []
}
```

### Step 3: Open Frontend
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 4: Navigate to Comment Section
1. Click on "Special Donations" tab
2. Click on a campaign (e.g., "Ojwang' Memorial Fund")
3. Scroll down to "💬 Community Comments" section
4. You should see the comment form!

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Cannot GET /api/comments/special-donation/1"
**Solution:** Backend server is not running
```powershell
cd backend
node server.js
```

### Issue: "Connection refused"
**Solution:** Backend is not listening on port 5000
- Check if port 5000 is in use: `netstat -ano | findstr :5000`
- Kill process: `taskkill /PID <PID> /F`
- Restart backend

### Issue: "CORS error"
**Solution:** Backend CORS is not configured
- Check `backend/server.js` line 8: `app.use(cors());`
- Should be there and working

### Issue: Comments not loading
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- Look for error messages
- Check Network tab to see API calls
