## 🎯 WHY YOU CAN'T SEE IT

**The comment section is fully implemented, but you can't see it because:**

❌ **The backend server is NOT running**

The CommentSection component fetches comments from:
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/comments/special-donation/:campaignId
```

**Solution:** Start the backend server (see Quick Start above)
