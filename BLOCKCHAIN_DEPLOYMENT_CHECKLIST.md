## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Install dotenv: `npm install dotenv`
- [ ] Create `.env` file with:
  ```
  MUMBAI_RPC_URL=https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com
  POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com
  PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
  POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```
- [ ] Verify `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Never commit private keys!

### Wallet Setup
- [ ] Create or import wallet
- [ ] Get wallet address
- [ ] Secure private key
- [ ] Get Mumbai testnet MATIC from faucet
- [ ] Verify wallet has funds

### Contract Verification
- [ ] Compile contracts: `npx hardhat compile`
- [ ] Run tests: `npx hardhat test`
- [ ] Check for warnings/errors
- [ ] Verify all contracts compile

## 🚀 Mumbai Testnet Deployment

### Step 1: Get Test Funds
- [ ] Go to https://faucet.polygon.technology/
- [ ] Select "Mumbai" network
- [ ] Enter wallet address
- [ ] Receive test MATIC
- [ ] Verify balance in wallet

### Step 2: Deploy Contracts
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-all-new.js --network mumbai
```

- [ ] Deployment completes successfully
- [ ] All contract addresses logged
- [ ] Addresses saved to deployedAddresses.json
- [ ] Addresses saved to frontend config

### Step 3: Verify Contracts
```bash
# For each contract, run:
npx hardhat verify --network mumbai <ADDRESS> <CONSTRUCTOR_ARGS>
```

- [ ] ProposalManagement verified
- [ ] FundAllocation verified
- [ ] DonationTracking verified
- [ ] VotingGovernance verified
- [ ] CharityDAOPlatform verified

### Step 4: Test on Mumbai
- [ ] Make a test donation
- [ ] Create a test proposal
- [ ] Vote on proposal
- [ ] Execute proposal
- [ ] Check treasury balance
- [ ] Verify M-Pesa integration

## 🔗 Frontend Integration

### Update Configuration Files
- [ ] Update `charity-dao-frontend/src/config/deployedAddresses.ts`
- [ ] Update `charity-dao-frontend/src/utils/web3.ts`
- [ ] Add Mumbai network configuration
- [ ] Add Polygon mainnet configuration

### Test Frontend
- [ ] Connect wallet to Mumbai testnet
- [ ] View treasury status
- [ ] Make a test donation
- [ ] Create a proposal
- [ ] Vote on proposal
- [ ] Execute proposal

---

## 🔐 Security Review

### Before Mainnet
- [ ] Review all contract code
- [ ] Check for reentrancy vulnerabilities

## 💰 Mainnet Deployment (Production)

### Pre-Mainnet
- [ ] Successful Mumbai testnet deployment
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Frontend integration verified
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Team approval obtained

### Mainnet Deployment
- [ ] Acquire mainnet MATIC
