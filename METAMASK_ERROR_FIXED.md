# âœ… MetaMask Error - FIXED!

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was the Problem?

You were seeing this error:
```
Uncaught runtime errors:
Ã—
ERROR
Failed to connect to MetaMask
```

This happened because the app was trying to connect to MetaMask on startup, and MetaMask wasn't available or connected.

---

## âœ… What We Fixed

We updated `charity-dao-frontend/src/App.tsx` to gracefully handle MetaMask connection failures:

### Changes Made:

1. **Wrapped MetaMask connection in try-catch**
   - App no longer crashes if MetaMask is not available
   - Shows helpful message in console instead

2. **Made blockchain features optional**
   - App works perfectly without MetaMask
   - Special Donations tab works without blockchain connection
   - Blockchain features only activate when MetaMask is connected

3. **Improved error messages**
   - Clear console messages explaining what's happening
   - No scary error toasts for expected failures

```
MetaMask not connected (this is normal): [error message]
