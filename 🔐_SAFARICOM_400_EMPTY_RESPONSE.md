# 🔐 Safaricom 400 Empty Response - Diagnosis

## 🎯 **The Issue**

Safaricom is returning a **400 error with an empty response body**:

```
❌ Status code: 400
❌ Response data: (empty)
❌ Content-Type: text/plain
❌ Content-Length: 0
```

---

## 🔍 **What This Means**

When Safaricom returns 400 with empty body, it usually means:

1. **Sandbox credentials expired** ⏰ (MOST LIKELY!)
2. **Safaricom API issue** 🔧
3. **Render's IP blocked** 🚫
4. **Invalid request format** 📋

---

## ✅ **What We Verified**

- ✅ Credentials are correctly formatted
- ✅ Base64 encoding is correct
- ✅ Authorization header is valid
- ✅ Request is reaching Safaricom
- ✅ Backend is running
- ✅ Network connectivity is working

## 🎯 **Most Likely Cause: Sandbox Credentials Expired**

Safaricom sandbox credentials typically:
- Expire after 30-90 days
- Need to be regenerated
- Are tied to your Daraja account
