# 🔧 GitHub Pages Troubleshooting - Still Showing README?

## What's Happening

You're seeing the **README.md** instead of your React app. This is normal! Here's why and how to fix it.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Check GitHub Actions Status

1. Go to: https://github.com/Chaseway132/mwanachi-charity-dao/actions
2. Look for the latest workflow run
3. Check if it says:
   - ✅ **Green checkmark** = Success! (but GitHub Pages might need time to update)
   - ❌ **Red X** = Build failed (check logs)
   - ⏳ **Yellow circle** = Still running (wait a few minutes)

---

## ✅ Step 2: Check GitHub Pages Settings

1. Go to: https://github.com/Chaseway132/mwanachi-charity-dao/settings/pages
2. Verify these settings:
   - **Source**: "Deploy from a branch"
   - **Branch**: "gh-pages"
   - **Folder**: "/ (root)"

If settings are different, change them to match above.

## ✅ Step 3: Hard Refresh Your Browser

The README might be cached. Try:

**Windows/Linux:**
```
Ctrl + Shift + R
```

**Mac:**
```
Cmd + Shift + R
```

Or clear your browser cache completely.

---

## ✅ Step 4: Wait 5-10 Minutes

GitHub Pages can take a few minutes to update after deployment. 

**Timeline:**
- 0-2 min: GitHub Actions builds
- 2-3 min: GitHub Actions deploys
- 3-5 min: GitHub Pages updates
- 5-10 min: Browser cache clears

---

## ✅ Step 5: Check for Build Errors

If GitHub Actions shows ❌ (failed):

1. Click on the failed workflow
2. Scroll down to see the error
3. Common errors:
   - **"npm ERR!"** = Dependency issue
   - **"Cannot find module"** = Missing file
   - **"Build failed"** = Code error

---

## 🆘 If Still Not Working

### Option A: Manual Deployment

```bash
cd charity-dao-frontend
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### Option B: Check Build Locally

```bash
cd charity-dao-frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

If build fails locally, fix the errors first.

### Option C: Verify 404.html Exists

Check that this file exists:
```
charity-dao-frontend/public/404.html
```

If missing, create it with SPA routing code.
