## 🚀 **What to Do Now**

### Step 1: Wait for Render Redeploy
- Render is redeploying now (1-2 minutes)
- Wait for "Deploy successful"

### Step 2: Test M-Pesa Again
1. Go to: https://chaseway132.github.io/mwanachi-charity-dao/
2. Find M-Pesa payment form
3. Enter phone: `0712345678`
4. Enter amount: `1`
5. Click "Send STK Push"

### Step 3: Check Render Logs
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click your backend service
3. Click **"Logs"** tab
4. Look for the new detailed output

### Step 4: Share the Logs
Copy and share the logs that show:
```

📡 Request headers: { ... }
❌ Error getting M-Pesa access token: ...
