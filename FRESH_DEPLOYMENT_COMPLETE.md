## 🎯 Next Steps - M-Pesa Testing

Once your site is verified working:

### 1. **Test M-Pesa Sandbox** (This is why we needed the public URL!)
   - Your site is now publicly accessible
   - M-Pesa callbacks can reach your backend
   - You can test the full payment flow

### 2. **Configure M-Pesa Sandbox**
   - Get credentials from Safaricom Daraja
   - Set callback URL to your backend
   - Test STK Push (mobile payment prompt)

### 3. **Test Full Flow**
   - User initiates donation
   - M-Pesa STK Push appears on phone
   - User enters PIN
   - Payment confirmed
   - Donation recorded on blockchain

## 🛠️ How to Deploy Again in Future

If you need to deploy again:

```bash
cd charity-dao-frontend
npm run deploy
```

That's it! It will:
1. Build your app
2. Deploy to gh-pages
3. Update your live site

---

## 📊 Build Output Summary

```
✅ Build successful
✅ 244.21 kB (main JS)
✅ 8.99 kB (CSS)
✅ 1.78 kB (chunk)
✅ Published to gh-pages
```

---

## 🚨 If Still Showing 404

1. **Hard refresh**: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
2. **Wait 5 more minutes** - GitHub Pages can be slow
3. **Clear browser cache completely**
4. **Try incognito/private mode**
5. **Check GitHub Pages settings** - should show gh-pages branch

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Blank Page?
- Check browser console (F12)
- Look for JavaScript errors
- Check network tab for failed requests

### Features Not Working?
- Check console for errors
- Verify blockchain connection
- Check contract addresses

### Still 404?
- Verify gh-pages branch exists: `git branch -a`
- Check GitHub Pages settings
- Wait longer (GitHub can take 5-10 min)

---

## ✅ You're All Set!

Your app is:
- ✅ Deployed to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Publicly accessible online
- ✅ Ready for M-Pesa testing
- ✅ Ready for production

---

## 🎉 Next: M-Pesa Integration
