# 🔗 Blockchain Status & Deployment Plan

## ✅ Current Blockchain Status

### **Smart Contracts - ALL INTACT & READY**

✅ **5 Core Contracts Deployed:**
1. **ProposalManagement.sol** - Proposal creation, voting, execution
2. **DonationTracking.sol** - Track all donations on-chain
3. **VotingGovernance.sol** - DAO voting mechanism
4. **FundAllocation.sol** - Fund distribution logic
5. **CharityDAOPlatform.sol** - Main platform orchestrator

✅ **Special Donations Contract:**
- **TransparencyLedger.sol** - Immutable on-chain ledger for special donations
- Ready for deployment
- Includes events for all operations

### **Hardhat Configuration - READY**

✅ **Networks Configured:**
- **Ganache** (Local development) - ChainId: 1337
- **Polygon Mumbai** (Testnet) - ChainId: 80001
- **Polygon Mainnet** (Production) - ChainId: 137

✅ **Deployment Scripts Available:**
- `deploy-all-new.js` - Deploy all contracts
- Multiple verification and testing scripts

---

## 📋 What's Needed for Polygon Deployment

### **1. Environment Variables (CRITICAL)**

Add to `.env` file:

```env
# Private Key for deployment (DO NOT COMMIT THIS!)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Polygon RPC URLs (optional - defaults are configured)
MUMBAI_RPC_URL=https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com
POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com

# PolygonScan API Key (for contract verification)
POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=your_polygonscan_api_key_here
```

### **2. Funding for Gas Fees**

**Mumbai Testnet (FREE):**
- Get free MATIC from: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
- Takes 1-2 minutes

**Polygon Mainnet (PAID):**
- Need real MATIC tokens
- Estimated cost: $5-20 USD for all deployments
- Can bridge from Ethereum or buy from exchange

### **3. MetaMask Setup**

✅ **Already configured in hardhat.config.js**
- Just need private key in .env

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps (Today)

### **Step 1: Get Test MATIC (5 minutes)**

1. Go to: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
2. Connect MetaMask wallet
3. Select Mumbai Testnet
4. Request MATIC (you'll get 0.5 MATIC)
5. Wait 1-2 minutes

### **Step 2: Get Private Key from MetaMask**

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click account menu → Account details
3. Click "Export Private Key"
4. Copy the key (starts with 0x)
5. Add to `.env`:
```env
PRIVATE_KEY=0xyourprivatekeyhere
```

### **Step 3: Deploy to Mumbai Testnet**

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-all-new.js --network mumbai
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Deploying all contracts from scratch...
Deploying with account: 0x...
ProposalManagement deployed to: 0x...
DonationTracking deployed to: 0x...
VotingGovernance deployed to: 0x...
FundAllocation deployed to: 0x...
CharityDAOPlatform deployed to: 0x...
```

### **Step 4: Deploy TransparencyLedger (Special Donations)**

Create `scripts/deploy-transparency-ledger.js`:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
  console.log(`Deploying with account: ${deployer.address}`);

  const TransparencyLedger = await ethers.getContractFactory("TransparencyLedger");
  const ledger = await TransparencyLedger.deploy();
  await ledger.waitForDeployment();
  
  const address = await ledger.getAddress();
  console.log(`TransparencyLedger deployed to: ${address}`);
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

Then run:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-transparency-ledger.js --network mumbai
```

### **Step 5: Update Frontend with Contract Addresses**

Copy deployed addresses to:
- `charity-dao-frontend/src/utils/contractAddresses.ts`

## ⏱️ Time Estimate

| Task | Time |
|------|------|
| Get test MATIC | 5 min |
| Get private key | 2 min |
| Deploy all contracts | 3-5 min |
| Deploy TransparencyLedger | 2-3 min |
| Update frontend | 5 min |
| **TOTAL** | **20-25 min** |

## 🔐 Security Notes

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:**
- Never commit `.env` file with private key
- Use different keys for testnet and mainnet
- Test thoroughly on Mumbai before mainnet
- Keep private key secure
