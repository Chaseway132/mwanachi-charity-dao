# ✅ Project Understanding Complete

## 🎯 What I've Learned About Your Project

Your **Mwanachi Charity DAO** is a sophisticated blockchain-based charity platform that solves a real problem in Kenya: **transparency in charitable fund management**.

### The Problem You're Solving
> "We don't want people sitting behind the tent and eating all the funds while they give us funny stories."

### Your Solution
A **decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)** that:
1. **Records every donation** on the blockchain (immutable)
2. **Accepts M-Pesa payments** (familiar to Kenyans)
3. **Lets community vote** on fund allocation (transparent)
4. **Tracks fund distribution** (verifiable)
5. **Supports emergency fundraising** (special donations)
