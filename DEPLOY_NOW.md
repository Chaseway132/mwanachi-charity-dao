# ðŸš€ Deploy Your App NOW - 3 Simple Steps

## What I Fixed

âœ… Added `homepage` to package.json
âœ… Created `404.html` for SPA routing  
âœ… Created GitHub Actions workflow

---

## Step 1: Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages deployment - add homepage and 404.html"
```

---

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

## Step 3: Wait for Deployment

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Watch the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow run
4. Wait for green checkmark âœ…

---

## Verify It Works

### After deployment completes:

1. Go to: `https://chaseway132.github.io/Mwanachi-Charity-DAO`
2. You should see your **React app** (not README!)
3. Click on different tabs to test routing
4. Hard refresh if needed: `Ctrl+Shift+R`

---

## What Changed

### File 1: `charity-dao-frontend/package.json`
```json
"homepage": "https://chaseway132.github.io/Mwanachi-Charity-DAO"
```

### File 2: `charity-dao-frontend/public/404.html`
```html
<!-- New file for SPA routing -->
```

### File 3: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
```yaml
<!-- New GitHub Actions workflow -->
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Still showing README?
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
- Wait 5 minutes
- Check Actions tab for errors

### Blank page?
- Check browser console (F12)
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Verify homepage in package.json

### Routes not working?
- Verify 404.html exists
- Hard refresh page
- Check browser console
