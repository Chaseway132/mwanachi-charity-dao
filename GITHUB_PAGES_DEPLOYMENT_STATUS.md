# 📊 GitHub Pages Deployment Status

## ✅ What I Just Did

1. **Added gh-pages package** to your project
   - Installed: `npm install --save-dev gh-pages`
   - This enables manual deployment to GitHub Pages

2. **Added deploy script** to package.json
   - New script: `npm run deploy`
   - This builds and deploys your app in one command

3. **Pushed all changes** to GitHub
   - GitHub Actions workflow will now run automatically
   - New build is being deployed

---

## 🚀 Current Status

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- ✅ Pushed to main branch
- ⏳ GitHub Actions is building your app
- ⏳ Deploying to gh-pages branch
- ⏳ GitHub Pages is updating

### Timeline
```
Now:        Changes pushed
0-2 min:    GitHub Actions builds
2-3 min:    GitHub Actions deploys
3-5 min:    GitHub Pages updates
5-10 min:   Browser cache clears
```

---

## 🔍 How to Check Status

### 1. Check GitHub Actions
Go to: https://github.com/Chaseway132/mwanachi-charity-dao/actions

Look for the latest workflow:
- ✅ **Green checkmark** = Success!
- ❌ **Red X** = Failed (check logs)
- ⏳ **Yellow circle** = Running

### 2. Check GitHub Pages
Go to: https://github.com/Chaseway132/mwanachi-charity-dao/settings/pages

Verify:
- Source: "Deploy from a branch"
- Branch: "gh-pages"
- Folder: "/ (root)"

### 3. Visit Your Site
Go to: https://chaseway132.github.io/Mwanachi-Charity-DAO

Expected result:
- ✅ React app loads
- ✅ Dashboard visible
- ✅ All navigation works

## 📋 What Changed

### File 1: `charity-dao-frontend/package.json`
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-app-rewired start",
  "build": "react-app-rewired build",
  "test": "react-app-rewired test",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject",
  "deploy": "npm run build && gh-pages -d build"  // ← NEW
}
```

### File 2: `charity-dao-frontend/package-lock.json`
- Updated with gh-pages dependency

### File 3: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Already created in previous push
- Automatically runs on every push to main

---

## 🎯 What Happens Next

### Automatic (GitHub Actions)
1. GitHub Actions detects push to main
2. Runs workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
3. Installs dependencies
4. Builds React app
5. Deploys to gh-pages branch
6. GitHub Pages serves the app

### Manual (If Needed)
```bash
cd charity-dao-frontend
npm run deploy
```

This manually builds and deploys without waiting for GitHub Actions.
