- Set up database (Firebase/MongoDB)
- Create production environment config

### Phase 2: Testing (Week 2)
- Deploy to Polygon Mumbai testnet
- Integrate database into backend
- Test M-Pesa end-to-end

### Phase 3: Security (Week 3)
- Smart contract security audit
- Backend security hardening
- Load testing

### Phase 4: Launch (Week 4)
- Deploy to Polygon mainnet
- Deploy backend to production
- Deploy frontend to production
- Monitor and support

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Start with this order:**

1. **Week 1:** M-Pesa credentials + Database setup
2. **Week 2:** Deploy to Mumbai testnet + Database integration
3. **Week 3:** Backend production setup + M-Pesa testing
4. **Week 4:** Mainnet deployment + Frontend deployment

This gets you to production in 4 weeks with a solid foundation.
