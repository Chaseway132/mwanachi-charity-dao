# 🎉 Navigation Fix - COMPLETE!

## ✅ PROBLEM FIXED!

The issue where clicking "View & Donate" took you back to the dashboard has been **FIXED**!

---

## 🔧 WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM?

The app was using **tab-based navigation** (state-based), but the `SpecialDonationsList` component was trying to use **React Router links** (`/special-donations/:id`). Since React Router wasn't set up for that route, clicking the button would just reload the page and go back to the dashboard.

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS FIXED?

### **1. Updated App.tsx**
- Added new tab type: `'special-donation-detail'`
- Added state: `selectedCampaignId` to track which campaign is being viewed
- Added case for `'special-donation-detail'` in `renderContent()`
- Imported `SpecialDonationDetail` component
- Pass `onSelectCampaign` callback to `SpecialDonationsList`

### **2. Updated SpecialDonationsList.tsx**
- Added `onSelectCampaign` prop
- Changed "View & Donate" button from `<a>` tag to `<button>`
- Button now calls `onSelectCampaign(campaign.id)` instead of using href

### **3. Updated SpecialDonationDetail.tsx**
- Removed React Router imports (`useParams`, `useNavigate`)
- Added props: `campaignId` and `onBack`
- Updated to use props instead of URL params
- Back button now calls `onBack()` callback

---

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS NOW

### **Flow:**
1. User clicks "View & Donate" on a campaign card
2. `onSelectCampaign(id)` is called
3. `selectedCampaignId` state is updated
4. `activeTab` is changed to `'special-donation-detail'`
5. Campaign detail page is displayed
6. User clicks "Back to Campaigns"
7. `onBack()` is called
8. `activeTab` is changed back to `'special-donations'`
9. Campaign list is displayed again
