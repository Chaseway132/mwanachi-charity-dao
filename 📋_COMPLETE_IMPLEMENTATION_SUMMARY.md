## Your Smart Contracts - What's Happening

### Current State
```
✅ DonationTracking.sol - Records crypto donations
✅ CharityDAOPlatform.sol - Main orchestrator
✅ FundAllocation.sol - Fund distribution
✅ ProposalManagement.sol - Proposals
✅ VotingGovernance.sol - Voting
✅ TransparencyLedger.sol - Special donations
```

### What I'm Adding
```
✅ recordMPesaDonation() function
✅ MPesaDonation struct
✅ Duplicate receipt prevention
✅ MPesaDonationReceived event
✅ Phone number tracking
```

### How It Works
```
User pays M-Pesa
    ↓
Backend receives callback
    ↓
Backend records in database
    ↓
Backend calls smart contract
    ↓
Smart contract records on-chain
    ↓
Event emitted
    ↓
PolygonScan shows transaction
    ↓
Immutable record created
```

## How M-Pesa + Blockchain Works

### Payment Flow
```
1. User enters phone & amount
2. Frontend calls /api/mpesa/stk-push
3. Backend initiates STK Push
4. M-Pesa sends prompt to phone
5. User enters PIN
6. M-Pesa sends callback
7. Backend records donation
8. Backend calls smart contract
9. Smart contract records on-chain
10. Frontend shows confirmation
```

### On-Chain Recording
```
Function: recordMPesaDonation(donor, amount, receipt, phone)
Event: MPesaDonationReceived(id, donor, amount, receipt, phone, timestamp)
Storage: Immutable on Polygon blockchain
Verification: Visible on PolygonScan
```

---

## Cost Breakdown

### One-Time
```
M-Pesa Credentials: Free
Domain (optional): $10-15/year
```

### Per Transaction
```
M-Pesa Fee: 2-3% of amount
Blockchain Fee: ~$0.01-0.10
Total: ~3-4% per donation
```

### Monthly
```
Frontend (GitHub Pages): Free
Backend (Railway): Free ($5 credit)
Database (if needed): Free tier available
Total: Free for first month
```

---
