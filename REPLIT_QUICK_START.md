# 🚀 REPLIT QUICK START - JUST CLICK RUN!

## ✅ Files Already Created!

I've already created the necessary files for you:

1. ✅ `.replit` file - Tells Replit how to run your backend
2. ✅ `backend/.env` file - Contains all environment variables including:
   - `JWT_SECRET` - For authentication
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - For admin login
   - `MPESA_*` - M-Pesa sandbox credentials (already configured!)
   - `PORT=5000` - Backend port
   - `NODE_ENV=production` - Production mode

## 🎯 WHAT TO DO NOW IN REPLIT

### **Step 1: Refresh Replit**
1. Go back to your Replit tab
2. Press F5 to refresh
3. You should see the `.replit` file in the file explorer

### **Step 2: Click "Run" Button**
1. Look for the green "Run" button at the top
2. Click it
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for dependencies to install

### **Step 3: Watch the Console**
You should see output like:
```
npm install
npm start
Server running on port 5000
```

### **Step 4: Get Your Backend URL**
1. Look at the top right of Replit
2. You'll see a URL like: `https://mwanachi-charity-dao.replit.dev`
3. **Copy this URL** - you'll need it for the frontend

### **Step 5: Test Backend**
Visit this URL in your browser:
```
https://your-replit-url.replit.dev/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "Backend is running",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

## 🔧 UPDATE FRONTEND

Once backend is running, I'll help you update the frontend with your backend URL.

**File to update**: `charity-dao-frontend/src/config/index.ts`

Change:
```typescript
export const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3001';
```

To:
```typescript
export const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-replit-url.replit.dev';
```

Then redeploy:
```bash
cd charity-dao-frontend
npm run deploy
```
