# 🚀 Failed to Fetch Error - Debugging Guide

## 🎯 **The New Error**

```
Error initiating payment: TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

This is **different from the 500 error** - it's progress! 🎉

---

## 🔍 **What This Means**

The `Failed to fetch` error typically means:

1. ❌ **CORS issue** - Backend not allowing requests
2. ❌ **Network timeout** - Request took too long
3. ❌ **Backend not responding** - Backend crashed
4. ❌ **Network connectivity issue** - Can't reach backend

---

## ✅ **What We Just Did**

Added **detailed logging** to the frontend to capture:
- ✅ Request URL
- ✅ Request method
- ✅ Response status
- ✅ Response data
- ✅ Error details

---

## 🚀 **What to Do Now**

### Step 1: Frontend is Updated
- ✅ Frontend rebuilt and deployed
- ✅ New logging is live at: https://chaseway132.github.io/mwanachi-charity-dao/

### Step 2: Test M-Pesa Again
1. Go to: https://chaseway132.github.io/mwanachi-charity-dao/
2. Find M-Pesa payment form
3. Enter phone: `0712345678`
4. Enter amount: `1`
5. Click "Send STK Push"

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
1. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for logs starting with:
   ```
   📱 Initiating M-Pesa payment...
   📞 Phone: 254712345678
   💰 Amount: 1
   🔗 Backend URL: https://mwanachi-charity-dao-backend.onrender.com/api/mpesa/stk-push
   📊 Response status: [number]
   📊 Response ok: [true/false]
   📊 Response data: { ... }
   ```

### Step 4: Check Render Logs
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click your backend service
3. Click **"Logs"** tab
4. Look for:
   ```
   POST /api/mpesa/stk-push
   📱 STK Push request received
   📝 Request data: { ... }
   ```

### Step 5: Share Both Logs
Share:
1. **Browser console logs** (from F12)
2. **Render backend logs** (from dashboard)
