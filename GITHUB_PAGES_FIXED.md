# ✅ GITHUB PAGES FIXED - WHITE SCREEN ISSUE RESOLVED!

## 🎯 What Was Wrong

The **homepage URL in package.json had a case mismatch**:

### Before (WRONG):
```json
"homepage": "https://chaseway132.github.io/Mwanachi-Charity-DAO"
```

### After (CORRECT):
```json
"homepage": "https://chaseway132.github.io/mwanachi-charity-dao/"
```

### Why This Matters:
- GitHub Pages URL is **lowercase**: `mwanachi-charity-dao`
- React was looking for assets at **uppercase**: `Mwanachi-Charity-DAO`
- Assets couldn't load → white screen

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

1. ✅ **Updated homepage URL** to match GitHub Pages lowercase URL
2. ✅ **Rebuilt the app** with correct asset paths
3. ✅ **Redeployed to gh-pages** branch
4. ✅ **Committed the fix** to main branch

## 🎯 Next Steps - M-Pesa Testing

Once your site is verified working:

### 1. **Test M-Pesa Sandbox** (This is why we needed the public URL!)
   - Your site is now publicly accessible
   - M-Pesa callbacks can reach your backend
   - You can test the full payment flow

### 2. **Configure M-Pesa Sandbox**
   - Get credentials from Safaricom Daraja
   - Set callback URL to your backend
   - Test STK Push (mobile payment prompt)

### 3. **Test Full Flow**
   - User initiates donation
   - M-Pesa STK Push appears on phone
   - User enters PIN
   - Payment confirmed
   - Donation recorded on blockchain

## 🛠️ How to Deploy Again in Future

```bash
cd charity-dao-frontend
npm run deploy
```

That's it! It will:
1. Build your app with correct paths
2. Deploy to gh-pages
3. Update your live site

## 🚨 If Still Showing White Screen

1. **Hard refresh**: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
2. **Wait 5 more minutes** - GitHub Pages can be slow
3. **Clear browser cache completely**
4. **Try incognito/private mode**
5. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors

### Common Errors:
- **404 on assets** - URL mismatch (now fixed)
- **Blank page** - JavaScript error (check console)
- **Slow loading** - GitHub Pages caching (wait longer)

---

## ✅ You're All Set!

Your app is:
- ✅ Deployed to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Publicly accessible online

- ✅ Ready for production

---

## 🎉 Next: M-Pesa Integration

Now that your site is live and accessible:
